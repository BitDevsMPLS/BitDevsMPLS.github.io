BitDevs is a community for those interested in discussing and participating in
the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well
versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. Be advised: discussion will
be technical.

### Socratic Seminars

We are starting a Socratic Seminar series in Minneapolis, inspired by other Bitdevs
across the country. Similar to the other meetups, these events are formatted to foster
debate, information sharing, and lively discussion. We will be curating content and
posting it to this website prior to the meetup. The topics will include developments
in popular Bitcoin and Lightning repositories, mailing lists, optech newletter,
and more. If there's a topic you'd like to discuss or present, [please reach out](https://twitter.com/m1sterc001guy)!
